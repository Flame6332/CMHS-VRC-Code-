Left + L2 -> Calibrate


// TO-DO:

- to mitigate damage to flipper, whenever the ball intake is
toggled, the flipper retracts

-??- "Enhanced Manual", hit X once to prime ball puncher for 2 seconds,
slows down control for aim, hit X again to fire

- if maxed out left stick horizontal direction, enable wiggle strafing,
for lining up platforms

- motor heat monitoring and warnings


// AUTONOMOUS TO-DO:

- for long programming runs, alignment with walls using accelerometer
bump detecting to calibrate drivetrain position

- prime puncher to 60% distance for faster ball shooting

- move functions run 3 stage slowdown to
